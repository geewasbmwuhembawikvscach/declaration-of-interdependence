# declaration-of-interdependence
The singular declaration, I, one of sovereign being and sound mind do affirm.

When in the Course of human events, 
it becomes necessary for one to dissolve the political, national, and cultural bands which have separated myself from the other, 
and to assume accountability for myself, others, and the commons, 
an interdependent and unequal station to which the chance of upbringing and derived privilege entitle me, 
a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that I should declare the causes which impel me to solidarity.

I hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that I am equal to all sentient Beings in my Existence, 
that I am endowed by grace of my being with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of expression of Being,
that I accept by such endowment, accountability for undeniable Responsibilities,
that among these are Mutual custody, Common stewardship, and defense of other expressions of Being.

--That to secure these rights, Protocols are instituted among Humans, deriving their just powers from the consent of the Interdependent, 
--That whenever any Form becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Interdependent to alter or to abolish it, 
and to institute new Forms or Protocols, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, 
as to them shall seem most likely to effect preservation of the Commons and expressions of all sentient Beings.
