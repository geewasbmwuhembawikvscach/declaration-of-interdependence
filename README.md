# declaration-of-interdependence
The singular declaration of, I, one of sovereign being and sound mind.

When in the Course of human events, 
it becomes necessary for one person to dissolve the political bands which have separated myself from the other, 
and to assume accountability for myself and others, 
an interdependent and unequal station to which the chance of upbringing and derived privilege entitle me, 
a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel me to solidarity.
